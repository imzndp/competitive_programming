/*
Starting with any positive integer N, we define the Collatz sequence corresponding to N as the numbers formed by the following operations:
N ? N/2 ( if N is even)
N ? 3N + 1 (if N is odd)
i.e. If N is even, divide it by 2 to get N/2.
If N is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3N + 1.
It is conjectured but not yet proven that no matter which positive integer we start with; we always end up with 1.
For example, 10 ? 5 ? 16 ? 8 ? 4 ? 2 ? 1
